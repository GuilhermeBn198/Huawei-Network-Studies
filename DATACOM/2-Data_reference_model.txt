▪ How the data is defined and transmitted in the network?
R:
data = information, and it is transmitted in the network throgh devices in binary format

▪ What are the five layers in the TCP/IP reference model?
R:
1. Physical Layer: transmit bitstreams over transmission media

2. Data Link Layer: encapsulates packets into frames, transmits frames in P2P or P2MP mode

3. Network Layer: Defines logical addresses in the network and transfers data

4. Transport Layer: stabilish, maintain and cancels an end-to-end data transmission process

5. Session Layer: stabilish, manages & determinates sessions between communicating parties

6. Presentation Layer: translates data formats to ensure that the application-layer data of one system can be identified by the application layer of another system

7. Application Layer: provides interfaces for applications

▪ What are the common standard protocols in each layer?
R:

Application Layer: telnet, FTP, TFTP, SNMP, HTTP, SMTP, DNS, DHCP

	FTP: FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL -> FTP transfers files from one host to another to implement file download and upload. 

	TELNET: A standar protocol that provides remote login services on a network, it gives users the ability to operate remote computers

	HTTP: HyperText Transfer Protocol -> HTTP is one of the most used network protocols on the internet. HTTP was originally designed to provide a method for publishing and receiving HTML pages

Transport Layer: TCP, UDP

network layer: ICMP, IGMP, IP
data link layer: PPPoE, Ethernet, PPP
Physical Layer: ...


▪ How the data is encapsulated and decapsulated?
